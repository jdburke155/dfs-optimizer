📋 GITHUB UPLOAD CHECKLIST
==========================

When uploading to GitHub, make sure you include ALL these files:

ROOT LEVEL FILES:
[ ] app.py
[ ] requirements.txt
[ ] .gitignore
[ ] QUICKSTART.md
[ ] ARCHITECTURE.md
[ ] DEPLOYMENT.md
[ ] README_GITHUB.md (rename this to README.md on GitHub)
[ ] validate.py

FOLDERS TO UPLOAD:
[ ] backend/ (entire folder with all .py files inside)
[ ] data/ (entire folder with sample_golf.csv inside)
[ ] .streamlit/ (entire folder with config.toml inside)

HOW TO UPLOAD FOLDERS:
======================
1. On GitHub upload page, drag the ENTIRE folder
2. GitHub will preserve the folder structure
3. Don't upload files individually from inside folders

AFTER UPLOADING:
================
1. Check that your GitHub repo shows this structure:
   
   dfs-optimizer/
   ├── app.py
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── README.md (the GitHub version)
   ├── QUICKSTART.md
   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
   ├── validate.py
   ├── backend/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── data_validator.py
   │   ├── game_modes.py
   │   ├── optimizer.py
   │   ├── rule_engine.py
   │   ├── monte_carlo.py
   │   └── exposure_manager.py
   ├── data/
   │   └── sample_golf.csv
   └── .streamlit/
       └── config.toml

2. If structure looks good, proceed to Streamlit deployment!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================
- Rename README_GITHUB.md to README.md when uploading
  (GitHub displays README.md on the main page)

- Make sure .gitignore and .streamlit folder upload correctly
  (Files starting with . are hidden on some systems)

- If you can't see hidden files:
  Windows: File Explorer → View → Show hidden files
  Mac: Press Command + Shift + . in Finder
